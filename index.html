SQL2NL
Converting SQL to natural language 
In this project, I want to explore the prospects of training a neural net to generate natural language from SQL inputs used to query relational databases. I envision a training data set with a variety of SQL query annotated with the corresponding natural questions queries, or any SQL to natural language one to one mapping. The driving question would be: Could we document SQL queries in natural language using NLP and NN?
