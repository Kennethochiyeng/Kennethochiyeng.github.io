<h2>Converting SQL to natural language</h2>
<p>
    <span>In this project, I want to explore the prospects of training a neural net to 
    generate natural language from SQL inputs used to query relational databases. i.e 
    Input SQL: SELECT SUM(SALES) FROM SALES WHERE SALES_DATE BETWEEN ... AND ... GROUP BY ...
    Output NL: "My total sales this month"
    I envision a training data set with a variety of SQL queries annotated with
    corresponding natural language questions, or any data set with a SQL and natural language one to one mapping. 
    The driving question would be: Could we document SQL queries in natural language using NLP/NLG and NN?
