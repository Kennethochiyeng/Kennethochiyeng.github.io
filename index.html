<h1>SQL2NL</h1>
<h2>Converting SQL to natural language</h2>
<p>In this project, I want to explore the prospects of training a neural net to 
    generate natural language from SQL inputs used to query relational databases. 
    I envision a training data set with a variety of SQL query annotated with the 
    corresponding natural questions queries, or any SQL to natural language one to one mapping. 
    The driving question would be: Could we document SQL queries in natural language using NLP and NN?
