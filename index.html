<h2>Converting SQL to natural language</h2>
<p> 
    In this project, I want to explore the prospects of training a neural net to
    generate natural language statements from SQL inputs used to query relational databases. i.e <br>
    Input SQL: SELECT SUM(SALES) FROM SALES WHERE SALES_DATE BETWEEN ... AND ... GROUP BY ...<br>
    Output NL: "These are your total sales this month"<br>
    I envision a training data set with a variety of SQL queries annotated with
    corresponding natural language statements, or any data set with a SQL to natural language one to one mapping. <br>
    The driving question would be: Could we document SQL queries in natural language using NLP/NLG and NN?<br>
</p>
<h3> Possible Architecture / Goals </h3>
<p>The goal is to generate a meaningful sentence taking into account the table/column names 
    in the input SQL and including the final result generated by the SQL on a database. 
    We would need to have some form of preprocessing to map out SQL keywords and comparators 
    like “SELECT” , “JOIN”, “<”, “>” etc. with expected translations in English to guide the training. <br>
    Since this is still an extremely underesearched field, we could take the comparative approach and experiement with 
    existing frameworks/architectures and report on the accuracy.
